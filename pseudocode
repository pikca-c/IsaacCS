Task 1 & 2, write an algorithm that returns sum of two numbers and compare the two numbers
Num 1 <- input first number
Num 2 <- input second number
Total <- Num1 + Num 2
Output Total
IF Num 1 == Num 2 THEN
  Output Num1 is the same as Num2
ELIF Num 1 > Num2 THEN
  Output Num1 is greater than Num2
ELSE
  Output Num2 is greater than Num1
